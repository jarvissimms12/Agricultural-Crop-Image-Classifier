# Image-Recognition-Model
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process visual data and provide instant classifications. I built this to explore how machines "see" patterns in pixels and to create a tool that could group images based on similar features. Results Accuracy: Achieved 96% on the test set.
